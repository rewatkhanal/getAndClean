### run_analysis.R is the R scripts for the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data.
### Here are the steps of getting the Teady Data known as "tidy_data.txt".

1. Downloading dataset from data source :https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2. Merging the training and the test sets to get one data set.
3. Extracting only the measurements by keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation.
4. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set by loading the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merging those columns with the dataset.
5. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive activity names.
6. Creating a tidy dataset, "tidy_data.txt", that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity.
